# Amazon SageMaker - How to use SageMaker?

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) is a modular, fully managed machine learning service that enables developers 
and data scientists to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale.

In this notebook, we will look at how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a machine learning (ML) model. 
We will use the popular XGBoost ML algorithm for this exercise.
